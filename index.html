      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQFiXt5U_o9SWQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0?e=1538006400&v=beta&t=BeTQifZqAYMgMMx5cBqSP1EktyS-JQQxsC-w6BMzOLs" class="auth-image" alt="Jordan Schechter">

      <p>I am a highly disciplined and goal oriented change maker with a range of experience in computer coding, digital marketing, political organizing, data analytics, and teamwork. I've utilized advanced digital marketing tools to design and operate some of the largest Democratic email fundraising programs in the country. With the tools I've gained in the professional world, coupled with the University of Denver's Full Stack Program, I want to become a software developer.</p>

      <p>
        I received a BA at West Virginia University in Political Science. From there, I spent years on the campaign trail, working for Congressional and Mayoral campaigns in the field. While working on these campaigns, I fell in love with running each digital program. While taking on this facet of the campaign, I gained new tools that led me to a digital fundraising firm where I worked for 2 years.</p>

      <p>When I'm not working with code, you can find me either on my bike, at happy hour with friends, or watching the Buffalo Bills (probably lose) on Sunday.</p>
